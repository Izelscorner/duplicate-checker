## Installation

## Some Assumptions
- I made it node compatibile since task requires command line arguments but tested on browsers as well.
- Filled the array with random numbers between 1 - n
- Used ES6 Typed arrays
- Given default size of the array is 1 million performance of this function is important, it performs on O(n) time compexity and O(n) Auxiliary Space, with little bit of more work Auxiliary space can be even better then this.
